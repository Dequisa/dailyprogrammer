However, your boss wants these words to follow a strict pattern of consonants and vowels. You are bad at creating words by yourself, so you decide it would be best to randomly generate them.  Your task is to create a program that generates a random word given a pattern of consonants (c) and vowels (v).| [consonantsandvowels.py](consonantsandvowels.py)|
