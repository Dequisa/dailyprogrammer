|---|---|---|
|[Challenge 234 [easy]](https://www.reddit.com/r/dailyprogrammer/comments/3moxid/20150928_challenge_234_easy_vampire_numbers)| A vampire number v is a number v=xy with an even number n of digits formed by multiplying a pair of n/2-digit numbers (where the digits are taken from the original number in any order) x and y together. Pairs of trailing zeros are not allowed. If v is a vampire number, then x and y are called its "fangs."  Given the number of fangs, find all vampire digits. | [vampirenumbers.py](/easy_challenges/vampirenumbers_v2.py) |
|[Challenge 235 [easy]](https://www.reddit.com/r/dailyprogrammer/comments/3nkanm/20151005_challenge_235_easy_ruthaaron_pairs)|In mathematics, a Ruthâ€“Aaron pair consists of two consecutive integers (e.g. 714 and 715) for which the sums of the distinct prime factors of each integer are equal. Your task today is to determine if a pair of numbers is indeed a valid Ruth-Aaron pair.| [ruthaaron.py](/easy_challenges/ruthaaron.py) |
|[Challenge 236 [easy]](https://www.reddit.com/r/dailyprogrammer/comments/3ofsyb/20151012_challenge_236_easy_random_bag_system)|Contrary to popular belief, the tetromino pieces you are given in a game of Tetris are not randomly selected. Instead, all seven pieces are placed into a "bag." A piece is randomly removed from the bag and presented to the player until the bag is empty. When the bag is empty, it is refilled and the process is repeated for any additional pieces that are needed.  In this way, it is assured that the player will never go too long without seeing a particular piece. It is possible for the player to receive two identical pieces in a row, but never three or more. Your task for today is to implement this system.|[tetrispieces.py](/easy_challenges/tetrispieces.py)|
|[Challenge 237 [easy]](https://www.reddit.com/r/dailyprogrammer/comments/3pcb3i/20151019_challenge_237_easy_broken_keyboard/) | Help! My keyboard is broken, only a few keys work any more. If I tell you what keys work, can you tell me the biggest word I can write?| [broken_keyboard.py](/easy_challenges/broken_keyboard.py)|
|[Challenge 238 [easy]](https://www.reddit.com/r/dailyprogrammer/comments/3q9vpn/20151026_challenge_238_easy_consonants_and_vowels/)|You were hired to create words for a new language. However, your boss wants these words to follow a strict pattern of consonants and vowels. You are bad at creating words by yourself, so you decide it would be best to randomly generate them.  Your task is to create a program that generates a random word given a pattern of consonants (c) and vowels (v).| [consonantsandvowels.py](/easy_challenges/consonantsandvowels.py)|
|[Challenge 239 [easy]](https://www.reddit.com/r/dailyprogrammer/comments/3r7wxz/20151102_challenge_239_easy_a_game_of_threes/) | The input is a single number: the number at which the game starts. Write a program that plays the Threes game, and outputs a valid sequence of steps you need to take to get to 1. Each step should be output as the number you start at, followed by either -1 or 1 (if you are adding/subtracting 1 before dividing), or 0 (if you are just dividing). The last line should simply be 1.| [game3s.py](/easy_challenges/game3s.py)|
|[Challenge 240 [easy]](https://www.reddit.com/r/dailyprogrammer/comments/3s4nyq/20151109_challenge_240_easy_typoglycemia/) | Taken an input of words, scramble each word leaving the first and last letters the same | [typoglycemia.py](/easy_challenges/typoglycemia.py)|
